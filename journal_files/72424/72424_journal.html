    <br> I felt as if the music page was becoming a journal of sorts and i kind of didnt want that. I guess I wanted some sort of outlet for thoughts as well, so im gonna split that off here.
    <br> as in like a sort of social media outlet that isnt on a dogshit platform that also people wont really look at all that often if at all 
    <br> I guess i just got pretty frustrated today cause i tried to start making stuff and it turned into another dammit why isnt my computer working session.
    <br> mostly just with soundfonts. i still havent really completely figured them out. yeah i just looked it might also be the fonts in some cases.
    <br> cause it seems like some instruments work and some dont. so i guess the possibilites are that:
    <br> juicysf has a problem that effects instruments with some specific attribute
    <br> the sample packs have issues on those instruments specifically
    <br> or maybe they just have issues with short decay? ugh
    <br> ok, worst case scenario? i use stfu to manually set the envelope on every single note
    <br> but i really, REALLY hope i dont have to do that because that is sooooo fucking annoying.
    <br> or if juicysf doesnt end up working out i can use sforzando
    <br> or if THAT doesnt even work, i can just manually edit the soundfonts envelopes in the sfz.
    <br> but i think that would be even more of a nightmare than stfu
    <br> ugghhhhhhhhhh
    <br> im tired i shouldve stopped a while ago
    <br> good night
