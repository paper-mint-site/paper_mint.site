    <br> i listened to nightmare knight again, and wanted to make something reminiscent of that. which was successful to some extent.
    <br> but overall i dont really like it. sounds a little bland. obviously the sounds are pretty rough. i just wanted to get the thing out.
    <br> but even the melody/cadences im not really in love with. also i rushed the section changes cause i dont wanna have to listen to the whole thing while i judge it
    <br> and whine about it lol
    <br> the intro, which seems to be the main motive, seems to be alternating between some dissonant minor F# keys
    <br> then he stays in f for the next couple measures, which is a little more relaxed, and transitions well to the a minor to g major arpeggiations he seems to be doing in the next section
    <br> then the melody that comes in seems to be somewhere in between those two keys. the lower melody next seems simple enough its just a basic support thing
    <br> the updownupdown thing is pretty simple. it just feels like a bit of a simplified extension of earlier keys. but i could be wrong about that
    <br> it becomes more about the percussion and counds in that section
    <br> next is the sped up melody from earlier. not too complicated.
    <br> nice when it gets cut out and thrown into the next section with the short up melodies and nice crashes.
    <br> really refreshing how simple these older pieces are for being so incredibly cool.
    <br> just really cool sounds, interesting melodies, rhythms and cadences, lots of change within the piece


    <br>
    <br> i like the sound that enemy approaching has. its a really upbeat fun piece wanna take it apart to hear where that comes from
    <br> minor detail but some of the lower tones are doing an arpeggiation kinda thing
    <br> and that little flourish with the rising notes is nice. but i wanna look more fundamentally
    <br> anyways, it seems to alternate between f major and some other f scale by swapping out D# and E
    <br> other than that its just a nice lively tune.
    <br> it sort of creates this tone of like. anticipation?

    <br> man. i couldnt write like. anything today.
    <br> i mean, i was a little busy setting up the website, and signing up for school, couple of chores, setting up the living room, thinkin bout various stuff.
    <br> but even when i got to it i just couldnt do it. and its not like the stuff ive been writing the last couple of days has been groundbreaking, you know?
    <br> im glad im just focusing on music for right now. it really feels as if thats what i need. no matter how much i program/code/design the game,
    <br> the music was what was really special to me about undertale. and its not as if i can just go and make something special all of the sudden just
    <br> cause i feel like it or cause the game is finished. the music is going to be just as much work as any other part of the game.
    <br> not to mention the fact that i have to actually learn how to do it.
    <br> i really do think these entries are helping me. it feels as if writing "something" over and over will allow me to make very basic things, and come to understand those
    <br> basics very well. then ill know when something sounds sort of samey, or boring, or common, and i can change things up.
    <br> but i can only do that if i write lots, listen to lots, really pay attention to each piece of it. then, experiment with the things that i find, and
    <br> see if they actually work. like, today and yesterday, with the cadences. identifying which chord progressions were present, and how the melody was constructed,
    <br> then trying to make something out of a few of those essential pieces. having a good cycle between conjecture, and experience, and reparation, and repetition, i guess.
    <br> making a discovery, then making something that demonstrates that it is true. its just difficult to do that with music cause the feelings are so minute.
    <br>

    <br> not terrible <br>

    <br> title says it all. its sweet but its not original. very plain d major cadence
    <br> harder than it sounds to do something different. epecially while having a nice rhythm
    <br> its hard enough to listen for each interval. trying to consider everything it hard...
    <br> thats why im doing this though. ill get better at it
