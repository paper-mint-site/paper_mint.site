    <br> something needs to go between the trumpet flourishes on the first section. already did it on the second section of the first section,
    <br> need to do it on the first. not going to make it as crazy as the second section. not sure what im going to do though
    <br> strings section i think should hear the plain version before the cooler version of the strings part.
