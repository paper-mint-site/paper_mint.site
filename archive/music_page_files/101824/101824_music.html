    <br> heard some homestuck like tones this morning, wrote it down, ended up continuing.
    <br> i like it but its in its initial phases. needs more different sounds. honestly just wanna use the same sound pallette as toby fox for this kind of music.
    <br> but i also wanna be original. should i be a normie and just use 4front/dvs sax/magic 8? or should i try something weird???? idk ill continue this later.
    <br> in terms of the melody, i want to expand more. I have another section and a half written but theres no supporting tones yet so i left those out of this version.

    <br> made some changes, added some stuff. uploading this the day after, so not really sure what changes i made. lots of places i could go with this though.
    <br> main thing being what other sounds can i add that sound good. honestly sounds good just being chiptune + piano, but im tempted to try dvs sax to be like toby fox lol
    <br> im sure it would all be beneficial. more melody, more sounds, none of its BAD. as long as i keep different versions of the song and have an organized backup kind of scheme,
    <br> i can go back to a version where the project was organized/made sense. kinda wanna learn more github so i can do that.
