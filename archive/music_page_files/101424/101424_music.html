    <br> EPIC NUTS MIXTAPE !!!!!!!
    <br> draft of a song for sample pack mini contest.
    <br> the intro is a little rushed for now so i can listen to the whole song more concisely.
    <br> ehhhhh i dunno how good the intro is anyway. those arpegiations are part of the sample, im pretty sure the sound wouldnt be good if i just tried to take the sound from it.
    <br> i think it sounds interesting anyways. definitely fits "spooky" theme. it feels like the jump from 8 bit to guitar is really hard. and i used both of the earthbound sounds even though i didnt really want to.
    <br> the beginning of the second section where guitar gets rad is a little plain. some sort of bass? undermelody of guitar? idk
    <br> need to have more main voices than just the guitar. just dont know which ones will work. could use the 440, ill consider it. but ill try to use something else first
