    <br> final version. going to force myself not to change this cause i feel like i spent waaaayyy too long on it despite it being pretty average.
    <br> im still getting used to finding "good" samples. though to be honest, i feel like its not that hard to find one good sample, the real challenge is more in finding
    <br> a set of samples that sound good together, that are fairly cohesive and match some sort of theme, you know? and this set feels fairly mixed. like "sampley", you know?
    <br> a lot of the other submissions had really good theming like the whats the point track had that really nice instrument in the beginning that had this really nice kinda
    <br> sadness to it, and the rest of the track really followed that well i think.
