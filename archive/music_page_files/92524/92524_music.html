    <br> did this while ripping chrono trigger samples.  think it sounds kinda nice. really tried to "progress" rather than sit on the same melody. at least with that one change from the first
    <br> arpeggiation to the downward arpegiation in the second section. but what actually causes that feeling of "change"? i mean, its all change, whether you change something minor or major.
    <br> swap out one percussion pattern with another, and the song will sound "new" and "different", if only a little. in order to get those big "section changes", you have to change a really
    <br> vital component, and make sure that the transition to the new component is smooth. this is obvious stuff, but the point is that i was pretty stuck making minor changes cause i didnt know if i
    <br> could handle making large changes. so i was doing smaller stuff. looking for the "easiest" next section. id like to change that. i think ill be able to as i get more experience composing,
    <br> but what im curious about is whether my sense for rhythm/harmony is sufficient to make what id like to. im sure that i can always be better. either way, what i need right now is more
    <br> compositional experience. i think? whatever, sounds right.

    <br> also, ive been stuck making "pretty" music, i need to make more exciting/riveting/battle kinda music.
