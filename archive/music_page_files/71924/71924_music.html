    <br> gonna have to crank up the volume for this one phone mic kinda ass dont feel like normalizing it
    <br> woke up with some sounds in my head. just some very basic but nice chord progressions. minecraftesque ending kinda.
    <br> i also had "its raining somewhere else" on my mind,but im not sure how similar it sounds to that.
    <br> added bonus of an extremely audible sniff at the end cause i just woke up and was kinda sleepy

    like home but not quite as cool<br>

    <br> was listening to various old toby fox pieces. theres really quite a lot of them. its really nice how simple some of them are.
    <br> home is literally just the nylon guitar and the music box from SGM with a little reverb, tastefully done. wanted to channel some of that.
    <br> really wish i had a piano. i always take for granted how nice having one at home is. hard to compose at the library.
    <br> i mean theres literally one outside. but theres also people there and i dont wanna bug them. also its embarrasing.
    <br> maybe ill just chill outside and use it for a bit after the library closes.

    <br> listening to an old snes kirby inspired toby fox piece from his website when that still existed. made me wanna make something with snes swag
    <br> but if you use magic 8 bit its gonna be more nes like. whatever i think it sound kinda cool
    <br> thats one of the things i really appreciate about magic 8 bit is how you can kinda just open up fl and have something cool written in like 30 minutes
    <br> or at least the frame of something. its not the "coolest" set of sounds you can use, but if you can kinda establish some melodies and rhythms that stuff
    <br> can carry to other creations in my opinion. i mean the zelda theme, super mario theme. koji kondo has been whipping up bangers since the 80s but the melodies have stayed the same p much
