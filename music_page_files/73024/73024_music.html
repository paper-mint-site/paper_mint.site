    <br> reminder to add fruity balances, disabled reverbs to your juicy sf template, potentially volume automations as well but probably not
    <br> anyways i elaborated on yesterdays thing. i think it sounds pretty cool, but i still think im being kinda lazy in terms of writing new melody.
    <br> i mean, theres only two melodies in the whole thing for the clavinet which was like the main voice. also, versus is more percussive and slow to
    <br> develop, and i kind of wanted that, but i ended up doing a more melodic thing.
    <br> ARGH IT WONT UPLOAD NEVERMIND UGH

    <br> reminder to add tempo automation to templates

    <br> this isnt related to anything specific but something i like to do which everyone probably does in some form is outline the chords of a song in piano
    <br> to summarize the "frame" of the song, or at least the harmonies, similar to sketching a model before doing a figure drawing.
    <br> thats a pretty basic thing, im sure everyone does that in some way. i just though it was worth recording/thinking about.
    <br> started making something from scratch with an amin, f#min, fmaj
    <br> amin -> fmin has this very regal but beautiful thing going for it.
    <br> wait. i think thats wrong. a minor triad ace, then inverted d maj f#ad, then f maj triad fac, then e maj triad eg#b
    <br> anyways i just started from chords. i dont really like the piece but i think the process is good. of recognizing the chords and using their sound
    <br> but im gonna go back to doing what i was doing keeping that in mind. i can explore chords on my own, or take them out of existing pieces. both
    <br> ways have their merits i think.


    <br> listening to descend by toby fox now. which might be a mistake because its a large composition which combines a ton of things.
    <br> also since i should probably go to bed before the sleepyness wears off gn
