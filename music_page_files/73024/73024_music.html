    <br> reminder to add fruity balances, disabled reverbs to your juicy sf template, potentially volume automations as well but probably not
    <br> anyways i elaborated on yesterdays thing. i think it sounds pretty cool, but i still think im being kinda lazy in terms of writing new melody.
    <br> i mean, theres only two melodies in the whole thing for the clavinet which was like the main voice. also, versus is more percussive and slow to
    <br> develop, and i kind of wanted that, but i ended up doing a more melodic thing.
