    <br> did this while ripping chrono trigger samples.  think it sounds kinda nice. really tried to "progress" rather than sit on the same melody. but what actually
    <br> causes that feeling of "change"? i mean, its all change, whether you change something minor or major. swap out one percussion pattern with another, and the song 
    <br> will sound "new" and "different", if only a little. in order to get those big "section changes", you have to change a really vital component, and make sure
    <br> that the transition to the new component is smooth. this is obvious stuff, but the point is that i was pretty stuck making minor changes cause i didnt know if i could handle 
    <br> making large changes. so i was doing smaller stuff. looking for the "easiest" next section. id like to change that. i think ill be able to as i get more experience composing,
    <br> but what im curious about is whether my sense for rhythm/harmony is sufficient to make what id like to. im sure that i can always be better. either way, what i need right now
    <br> is more compositional experience. i think?
