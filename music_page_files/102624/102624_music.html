    <br> i lied i changed it. i dont remember what i changed. actually submitted this one, ive got plenty of gripes about it but its all good i think. glad i made something for it.
    <br> feel like i learned a lot from using these samples. about kinda putting together a group of sounds/theming and stuff, lots of stuff you take for granted when you use
    <br> prelooped/tuned/polished/grouped/themed samples. lots of the work is done for you in creating the kind of identity/character of the sounds themselves. ive been able to make
    <br> some decent tracks lately, but ive been using snes samples, so theyre premade. which means ive been lacking in originality of sound. i want to do more sampling like this,
    <br> "from scratch". really learn the entire process, from being just an audio file, to being a good sample, to being adjusted to fit in a soundfont or other collection of sounds
    <br> to give music identity that way. i think theres a lot to learn from using premade sounds too though. you learn more compositionally/melodically using premade samples, but
    <br> you learn more about the sound by sampling and grouping sounds yourself. both are necessary. anyways.

    <br> made this cause i didnt like my original track cause the sound was a little. hmm. well it didnt feel like it had identity. or maybe the identity sounded a little generic to sampled music.
    <br> and i saw a couple of the other tracks that were submitted had some really cool sounds that were kinda "adventurish", specifically the scared stupid sample strings in the beginning.
    <br> then i ended up making something smrpg-esque. i like it in a way, but it didnt feel like something id wanna submit to the spc. funny "butt" song!

    <br> little offshoot track, one of the other samplerbros in the spc uploaded a mariomaker sample that was pretty cool so i made something out of it cause there were a lot of weird sounds in it
