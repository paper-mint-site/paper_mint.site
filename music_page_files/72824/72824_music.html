    <br> listening to yynem from zero ranger. wait it might have been comforting choccino. whatever i ripped the chord progression from one of those and did whatever i wanted with the rest of it
    <br> sounds pretty nice i think. that sgm vox fit much better than i expected. i honestly want to add some more sections, feel like it could be a longer song.
    <br> the last sections melody with the vox was kind of weird imo. i dont hate it its just a little plain. but the rest is good
    <br> i wanna add a little more melody/patterns/balancing/fx and tune it up but ill probably do that later. time to move on
    <br> it might be really loud i wrote this in a cafe i cant hear shit in here lol
    <br> also why does the vox kind of sound like mickey fucking mouse i cant unhear it dammit

    <br> listening to orangardimus from zero ranger. ripped the key and did whatever again. not sure i like the melody as much in this one. not as much character
    <br> also i almost never use orchestra hits but im not really a fan of how they sound here. it just felt like they might work in this piece, which they kinda do
    <br> and ive been meaning to use them more. so i tried it. meh. i still like them im just not that good at using them lol
    <br> like in BIGSHOT from deltarune toby fox uses hits to do like an actual part of the melody, which is kinda crazy and dumb but it sounds really cool lol
    <br> which is kind of toby foxes whole thing but yeah. id like to use them more in upbeat music
    <br> anyways i doubt ill elaborate on this much later, but time to move on

    <br> i added this weird chord porgression at the end of this one that kind of takes on this hopeful kinda tone that i sort of like but not really. it just doesnt fit this piece
    <br> i was unsure about it so i saved a version with that bit, other than that the song is pretty incomplete
    <br> starting to like this song a little less. its not BAD, its just a little derivative/basic/simple. im wondering how much more i could really add to these harmonies/rhythms you know?
    <br> feels like i need to change it up a lot more. i tend to get stuck with a certain rhythm/melody, partially cause its easier lol, but also i think cause thats the natural human
    <br> instinct with creative things is respond to things with similar things. so i guess its good to try to be able to identify when things start to feel "samey", and find some way to
    <br> change it up. like the second section where the second set of supports come in. do i really need those? probably not. i might have changed those out by now. they feel like theyre stretching out the piece too much, its boring
    <br> i mean im being vague when im saying change it up, but it really just come down to using a fundamentally different rhythm, melody, harmony, sample, you know. but toby foxes pieces are absolutely crazy,
    <br> so its hard to match that. hes constantly swapping sounds in and out, changing the melody up, and his melodies seem to come from this place of being very bored with current things.
    <br> like the melodies are just full of change and character you know? its really something. the more i write things like this the more im seeing these "openings" for where you can add something new/interesting
    <br> that i feel as if i couldnt see before. like a little place i can change the melody up, or an "unexpected" place to change the rhythm. but then i look back and see like well. thats
    <br> not so original/interesting/cool. which i guess is normal for improvement but its just strange that i feel so different about it since like just. yesterday. you know?
    <br> does that mean that im improving quickly? or just that im looking at the product and then thinking about what i can add? like that cs idea of making things modularly
    <br> then adding more/more? like obviously when you write something, any art piece, youre creating something out of nothing. so it stands to reason that youll have a better idea of
    <br> the concept of the thing youre creating after youve created it. i dont know if that makes sense. whatever
    <br> i do want to do more "takes" from certain motives cause it feels like that process specifically could be helpful. like oh ok i hear this melody. what other things are related to that?
    <br> specifically streamlining that process and becoming more efficient at hearing those different things. to be able to hear more "good options", and be able to sort through lots of them
    <br> quickly to find the "best" option. like with that one main pattern, all of the other stuff i came up with was things to add to that pattern. theyre all "good" musical options.
    <br> starting from that pattern, there are lots of different songs you could potentially make that would be decent. but how do you come up with more good things? i guess thats
    <br> what my teacher was saying is that you have to write bad music to write good music maybe. cause every day you keep writing music, and identifying patterns and melodies that you
    <br> see as "good" or "bad". then those sensibilities become a part of you. youll subconsciously start to think of more "favorable" melodies, and become more familiar with the process of differentiating between them
    <br> and selecting which ones you want. then analyze those things, then make more. just like piano, layering. thinking, "it should be more like this". then adding more sensibilities. is what ive been thinking.
    <br> i might be overcomplicating something simple. its just the basic idea of how people learn things i think. but i think its important to consider so that you can be more conscious of the way that you
    <br> learn and improve. im not trying to make it seem this easy or simple, the reality is that professionals probably have hundreds of thousands of sensibilities built up over years of creating/thinking/experience.
    <br> whatever i just wrapped it up like whatever the ending is just what it is i wanna move on i think. spent a little too much time on this


    <br><br> im getting a little stuck on undertale so i should try to change that but im gonna look at death by glamour then ill move on. cause its awesome


    <br> ok so literally 90% of the tonal flavor is expressed in that little EGDC# pattern, or at least thats what it sounds like to me. the rest of it is improvised additionally on top of that.
    <br> which is awesome. i feel as if i can see where he was going with that. anyways its just a thing to establish like, e minor? and also that 12341234123123341234123412312334 time. so swing?
    <br> wait nevermind im doing napstablook now cry about it

    <br> ok napsta is also using swing, and some weird g minor scale? so im gonna do something in swing but also in like a c minor something
    <br> anyways my initial melody isnt amazing but i like it. im trying lots of different supports/other things in the spirit of kinda what i was saying about entertaining all kinds of possibilities then analyzing them and choosing the first one.
    <br> the first one is a little too simplistic. also it sounds like a nursery rhyme or something that ive heard before that i cant quite put my finger on its not awful though
    <br> the second one is actually nice. i like the way that it has this little complicated but not too complicated rhythmatic theme of daaadanaanaaaaa and then breaks that theme a couple notes in.
    <br> then it comes back to that established theme a couple notes later, and warps it a little bit. thats good, reusing past bits later after theyve been abandoned on a smaller scale within melody
    <br> the third one is a little simplistic, but i think id like it if it were entered after a more complex melody as a sort of break u kno?
