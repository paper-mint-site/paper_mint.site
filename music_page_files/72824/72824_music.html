    <br> listening to yynem from zero ranger. wait it might have been comforting choccino. whatever i ripped the chord progression from one of those and did whatever i wanted with the rest of it
    <br> sounds pretty nice i think. that sgm vox fit much better than i expected. i honestly want to add some more sections, feel like it could be a longer song.
    <br> the last sections melody with the vox was kind of weird imo. i dont hate it its just a little plain. but the rest is good
    <br> i wanna add a little more melody/patterns/balancing/fx and tune it up but ill probably do that later. time to move on
    <br> it might be really loud i wrote this in a cafe i cant hear shit in here lol
    <br> also why does the vox kind of sound like mickey fucking mouse i cant unhear it dammit

    <br> listening to orangardimus from zero ranger. ripped the key and did whatever again. not sure i like the melody as much in this one. not as much character
    <br> also i almost never use orchestra hits but im not really a fan of how they sound here. it just felt like they might work in this piece, which they kinda do
    <br> and ive been meaning to use them more. so i tried it. meh. i still like them im just not that good at using them lol
    <br> like in BIGSHOT from deltarune toby fox uses hits to do like an actual part of the melody, which is kinda crazy and dumb but it sounds really cool lol
    <br> which is kind of toby foxes whole thing but yeah. id like to use them more in upbeat music
    <br> anyways i doubt ill elaborate on this much later, but time to move on

    <br> i added this weird chord porgression at the end of this one that kind of takes on this hopeful kinda tone that i sort of like but not really. it just doesnt fit this piece
    <br> i was unsure about it so i saved a version with that bit, other than that the song is pretty incomplete
    <br> starting to like this song a little less. its not BAD, its just a little derivative/basic/simple. im wondering how much more i could really add to these harmonies/rhythms you know?
    <br> feels like i need to change it up a lot more. i tend to get stuck with a certain rhythm/melody, partially cause its easier lol, but also i think cause thats the natural human
    <br> instinct with creative things is respond to things with similar things. so i guess its good to try to be able to identify when things start to feel "samey", and find some way to
    <br> change it up. like the second section where the second set of supports come in. do i really need those? probably not. i might have changed those out by now. they feel like theyre stretching out the piece too much, its boring
    <br> even the second melody set feels a little too similar to the first melody. i just wrapped it up like whatever the ending is just what it is i wanna move on
