    <br> listening to yynem from zero ranger. wait it might have been comforting choccino. whatever i ripped the chord progression from one of those and did whatever i wanted with the rest of it
    <br> sounds pretty nice i think. that sgm vox fit much better than i expected. i honestly want to add some more sections, feel like it could be a longer song.
    <br> the last sections melody with the vox was kind of weird imo. i dont hate it its just a little plain. but the rest is good
    <br> i wanna add a little more melody/patterns/balancing/fx and tune it up but ill probably do that later. time to move on
    <br> it might be really loud i wrote this in a cafe i cant hear shit in here lol

    <br> listening to orangardimus from zero ranger. ripped the key and did whatever again. not sure i like the melody as much in this one. not as much character
    <br> also i almost never use orchestra hits but im not really a fan of how they sound here. it just felt like they might work in this piece, which they kinda do
    <br> and ive been meaning to use them more. so i tried it. meh. i still like them im just not that good at using them lol
    <br> like in BIGSHOT from deltarune toby fox uses hits to do like an actual part of the melody, which is kinda crazy and dumb but it sounds really cool lol
    <br> which is kind of toby foxes whole thing but yeah. id like to use them more in upbeat music
    <br> anyways i doubt ill elaborate on this much later, but time to move on
