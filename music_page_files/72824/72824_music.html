    <br> listening to yynem from zero ranger. ripped the chord progression, did whatever i wanted with the rest of it
    <br> sounds pretty nice i think. that sgm vox fit much better than i expected. i honestly want to add some more sections, feel like it could be a longer song.
    <br> the last sections melody with the vox was kind of weird imo. i dont hate it its just a little plain. but the rest is good 
    <br> i wanna add a little more melody/patterns/balancing/fx and tune it up but ill probably do that later. time to move on
