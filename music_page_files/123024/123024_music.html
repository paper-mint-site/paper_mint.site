    <br> im not sure what i should be doing creatively right now. but i wrote this today after listening to sunsetter.
    <br>
    <br> sunsetter 2
    <audio controls>
        <source src="sunsetter 2.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> pretty simple layering thing. simple bright melody to give key in the beginning. 25 square octave chords, arpeggios and end melody to make dangerous
    <br> 25 square doesnt sound quite right. but its a good placeholder, has that growl i need it to have. just have to figure out the vibrato. it sounds a little tacky.
    <br> but without it it sounds plain. not sure if its just not quite the right speed/depth or if theres something about the sound quality i need to change
    <br> couple of the other melodies kind of got lost. its all just kinda blended together. which is kinda ok cause it just turns out chaotic but
    <br> make it intentional. just work on the balancing automation in general and itll be fine. i wanna finish this pretty definitively. biggest thing is that
    <br> its not changing enough. more change to rhythm, melody. it can definitely be that. just find that right balance i think i talked about before.
    <br> connected enough to the next section to feel like a cohesive idea, but not so connected that it feels like the same idea. right there, in that grey

    <br> percussion could use more variety. reverb is overwhelming. kinda hurts, its hard to hear it but kinda builds up ear stress. and it doesnt make that
    <br> much of a difference on the sound. lots of little effecty/polish stuff to touch up on in general. yeah it was the triangle wave. reverb is nice but be careful
    <br> wit it. also its just not balanced. at all. it just gets louder and everything gets mashed together. also i had a fucking reverb on the master??? i mustve been trying to put
    <br> on something else. something seemed wrong, guess thats one reason everything was so ringy.
    <br> meh im gonna do something else now i wanna do kirby dl3 samples, heres what i had:

    <br>
    <br> sunsetter_2_v2(1/4/25)
    <audio controls>
        <source src="sunsetter_2_v2.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>
    <br> same as before but i changed the stuff i talked about and made the fast arp section slidey and added a srubby pitch thing to the last section
    <br> original was 12/30, making changes on 010425
