    <br> im not sure what i should be doing creatively right now. but i wrote this today after listening to sunsetter.
    <br>
    <br> inside_clone_v1
    <audio controls>
        <source src="inside_clone_v1.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> pretty simple layering thing. simple bright melody to give key in the beginning. 25 square octave chords, arpeggios and end melody to make dangerous
    <br> 25 square doesnt sound quite right. but its a good placeholder, has that growl i need it to have. just have to figure out the vibrato. it sounds a little tacky.
    <br> but without it it sounds plain. not sure if its just not quite the right speed/depth or if theres something about the sound quality i need to change
    <br> couple of the other melodies kind of got lost. its all just kinda blended together. which is kinda ok cause it just turns out chaotic but
    <br> make it intentional. just work on the balancing automation in general and itll be fine
    <br> (uploading this days later, not sure if im uploading the correct song. oh well)
