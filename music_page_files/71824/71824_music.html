    <br> i opened fl studio to use sytrus to make something new and the sytrus strings preset it opened with was actually kind of nice. <br>
    nice to appreciate the simple stuff sometimes. feels as if this could be a nice sort of library or something. its really plain though...

    <br> more fucking around with sytrus. i listened to one of those ridiculously over the top guitar synths and got the urge to write something <br>
    reminiscent to an early 2000s punk rock themed older brother with a shitty early 90s civic who would blast megadeth out of his shitty speakers.<br>
    smells like the master chief themed burger king meal and cigarettes
