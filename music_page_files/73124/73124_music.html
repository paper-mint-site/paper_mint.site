    <br> add samplers to basic template, add tuners to samplers on basic template
    <br> looking at old sample pack contest stuff today. i really suck at sampling lol, i just dont get it.
    <br> i was doing well with soundfonts cause that part is already wrapped up. i think this is something ill want to get over if i want to have really good control of
    <br> the actual sound rather than thinking compositionally. so i guess maybe this is the next step? i dunno ill try it for a bit, its been a while anyways.
    <br> ok. so going back over the basics. the fundamental things with the stock fl sampler are:
    <br> pitch up/down, smp start and length, the envelope, the pitch envelope, using edison to add loop points, tuning, then fx.
    <br> i think i was overcomplicating it a bit. im glad im coming back to it though. basically i was having trouble finding where the sounds came from, 
    <br> but i couldt tell if i was just using the tools wrong or if they were using some tools that i didnt have. but nah, i just hadnt tried everything.
    <br> so when youre looking through samples to find good sound, try a few things.
    <br> pitch mod. envelope. sample length. but honestly for finding "new sounds" it feels as if pitching the sound up and down is the most basic thing that gives you the most variance.
    <br> hm. honestly im not really feeling this kind of music right now. im going back to descend lol
    <br> also group the samplers and shit in the default template, and add balances to the samplers


    <br> to be honest i need to be more fucking radical i think. i never fully appreciated having a sick ass drum beat and swag. thats what i need to be on, i need to be dave
    <br> ok i think a large part of why im having so much trouble is cause its so particular maybe? doing stuff with just the idea "ill make something that has this music theory concept",
    <br> like just ripping a key from a song to start out with is nice cause you can use any sound and go anywhere. but theres so much variance in the actual sounds of things, and if you dont have the specific sample that 
    <br> came from the original creator of the song youre listening to for reference it just wont be the same. so you have to get that sample or do something different. you really have to try a lot of samples, and sort of adapt to 
    <br> using whatever you can find.

    <br> adjust sampler inner volumes in v3

    <br> oh man i didnt even really write anything today i just fucked around looking for samples, trying to loop samples, looking through homestuck music etc etc etc. holy shit
    <br> i think this was a necessary day to have, but i feel as if ive spent long enough trying to sort all these things i have and just start making things. but i was trying to 
    <br> make "homestuck like" music, and those sounds are really particular. like they just have so much character that sure i could write those songs without them but what would even be the point
    <br> anyways i think collecting sounds is important, and organizing them as well, but ive just been doing it almost all day and it sort of doesnt feel as if its going anywhere.
    <br> in reality though eventually if you want to have "musical range", ur gonna have to be able to find all these different sounds and have them in an organized format so that you can find and use
    <br> them consistently anyways im going for a walk i might not be back. hopefully i can actually write something tonight but honestly i think just the organizing is doing me a lot of good
    <br> and figuring out "how to find samples" and how to find sounds and how to figure out how to use those sounds. it sounds really simple but somehow it just isnt.
    <br> do i look for sounds myself? to i try to find samples from artists i like? in reality itll be a combination of both. i guess i should just try to focus on being quick and efficient about it.
    <br> whatever brb maybe
