    <br> ok, i said i was going to move on yesterday but that was a lie lol. i guess there was still some stuff i wanted to do
    <br> little volume tweaking, chorus effect on the initial rhodes. some release on the voxes. its a little overly "effecty", but it sounds nice
    <br> thats really it. NOW im moving on

    <br> thought this little recording would be interesting to include just to show how basic the "actual idea" this was. kind of just the schoenberg way of thinking of motives as "seeds" that give birth
    <br> to new musical ideas. like i was just messing around on my piano learning the basic asgore melody and was like "well what if it was like this?" i guess overall i feel as if people sometimes
    <br> reject simple ideas/things in general as being sort of childish, or beneath them. so they dont consider it. but thats how things are made! just lots and lots of tiny pieces

    <br> i thought it would be interesting for this one to document versions of it incrementally, cause it seems like its going to take a little longer to compose (like 2-3 hours to the usual 30-45 min)
    <br> just cause it might be helpful for me to be able to see things as they're made. cause... idk it just seemed interesting lol. cause its literally just the fundamental parts right now.
    <br> so i guess its just interesting cause now i can assign whatever sounds/rhythms/whatever else to it that i want. or even change it up a little.
    <br> it just feels like having something like this written is a good "framework"
    <br>

    <br> getting a little closer. not sure what im gonna do about the intro. in terms of the sound of the whole thing... toby fox always had this really crazy and perfect mix and alternation between different
    <br> sampled sounds. so its hard to feel like the sounds ive chosen are right. magic 8 and most piano samples are really good for being prototypical sounds, that you can sub out later i think.
    <br> theyre very adaptable, but they dont have much punch alone. the drumkit is also temporary. it sounds very out of place lol, im either going to find another soundfont instrument, or try to make something
    <br> in m8bit i think. also the arp in the midsection is so boring lol. i subbed it out with a triangle and played with it a bit, so its a little closer, but theres really no punch.
    <br> i swapped out the synth strings for the normal ones. i think i like them better now but i still kind of want something different. ill dick with the equalizer/fx a bit maybe that will fix it. or ill try some other samples
    <br> also theyre just sort of. floating around on the right notes. they should have some sort of melody later.
    <br> i like the piano chords at the end though. i just eq/reverbed them they sound ok. i can tweak that more later. the cymbal-esque noise at the end though needs something.
    <br> in the last section, well i want there to be a section between the middle and end, but for the end itself, it feels rushed. like there should be another bar or something
    <br> but it kinda just goes straight to being "resolved". i might want to draw that out some more

    <br> ok i dont actually remember what i changed between this one and the last. i think i made a couple changes thinking that i was just going to add that to alpha 2.
    <br> but then there were enough changes that it deserved another iteration i think
    <br> think im done with this one for today. i like it, and i think it has lots of room to grow/change. but i wanna move on

    <br> ok im not gonna sugarcoat it i like this one quite a bit. it doesnt even sound too bad just on piano
    <br> although its a little derivative of megalovania, it feels like it has enough originality.
    <br> except for the flutter piano part that part is as cause i dont know how to make it not sound like shit lmao
    <br> but it represents what i want for later well enough
    <br> i honestly think theres a good chance those nice piano chords will make it into the "final version", but im not sure
    <br> 
    <br> also, its called megalowania because i want to start a video game music tradition of song naming cause live a live had megalomania
    <br> then there was toby foxes megalovania so i wanna keep it going through a couple generations of game music.
    <br> think of it. megaloxania. megaloyania. megalozania! mebolaganora!!!!
