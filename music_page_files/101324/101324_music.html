    <br> wrote something that i heard while i was coding cause i was bored. wanted something with the old toby fox homestuck kind of sound. didnt really turn out sounding much that way.
    <br> its ok. dont hate it. other than just the plainness of the sound, the melody is ok. nice alternation between quicker slower melody in the first section. 
    <br> not enough variance between the first and second section though. harmonies sound a little too similar. and the submelody in the first section is a little plain as well. wish it went somewhere more substantial.
    <br> its ok rhythmically, but it feels like the harmony doesnt change much. hmm.

    <br>
    <br> gonna listen to some toby fox stuff and try something different
