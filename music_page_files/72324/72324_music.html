    <br> was taking apart nightmare in more depth. the intro, which seems to be the main motive, seems to be alternating between some dissonant minor F# keys
    <br> then he stays in f for the next couple measures, which is a little more relaxed, and transitions well to the a minor to g major arpeggiations he seems to be doing in the next section
    <br> then the melody that comes in seems to be somewhere in between those two keys. the lower melody next seems simple enough its just a basic support thing
    <br> the updownupdown thing is pretty simple. it just feels like a bit of a simplified extension of earlier keys. but i could be wrong about that
    <br> it becomes more about the percussion and counds in that section
    <br> next is the sped up melody from earlier. not too complicated.
    <br> nice when it gets cut out and thrown into the next section with the short up melodies and nice crashes.
    <br> really refreshing how simple these older pieces are for being so incredibly cool.
    <br> just really cool sounds, interesting melodies, rhythms and cadences, lots of change within the piece
