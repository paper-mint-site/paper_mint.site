    <br> took fallen dove from the other day and made a few changes. added a new vox pattern at the end, tweaked some equalizers/envelopes, added some volume automation

    <br> still need to manually put envelopes onto the voxes with stfu, cause juicysf's envelopes arent working. or try sforzando and see if that works, i have a feeling it will.
    <br> i really like how this sounds, so im gonna move on from it. i have a feeling that this might be something that i come back to though
