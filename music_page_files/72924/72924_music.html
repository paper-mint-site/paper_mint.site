        <source src="ruins like proto.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> listened to ruins from undertale. wanted to make something similar. ruins seems to use some a minor or other mode. most audible on C and F as those are the lowered notes
    <br> made something with a similar melody in the same key using piano and space voice from sgm. came out ok. its not the most upbeat thing ever, but i dont think its supposed to be.
    <br> the sgm piano sounds are pretty nice, but the upper/ lower voices on 1 and 3 are meh. so i used piano 1 for lower, then piano 2 for middle tones. not perfect but it works. i guess
    <br> i could try a couple different things, but i dont think it would make a huge difference. ill mess with the eq later
    <br> in the main melody i dont think theres enough difference from the initial melody and the repsonse melody. i think the contrast between main and main 2 is good.
    <br> but just within main? the melody needs a little work. and in support 2, the melody and response arent different enough. it feels like only the rhythm changes
    <br> the first support is basic, but honestly i think its good that way. once another instrument/melody gets added there i think itll be enough.
    <br> the second support is nice too. i was saying earlier about it only being a rhythm change within it but it works cause thats just for the transition
    <br> not sure what other instruments i can add to it right now, and ill probably sub the space voice out once i find something better, but it sounds nice enough
    <br> dont know if im going to continue with this. whateva im moving on

    <br> uploading this on 730 but i wrote like 90% of this last night whilst listening to classic homestuck tunes, specifically versus, which was a toby fox piece
    <br> did i say i was going to try to look at a composer other than toby fox? i was lying :I started with the clavinet and wrote a similar sounding melody
    <br> but i started things from the beginning, toby fox does a pretty long slow buildup. but i think i want to get to know how to do that as well. builds anticipation,
    <br> mystery etc. im also starting to appreciate some of the sounds i didnt really like before, namely clavinet/slap bass. when you hear them for the first time they seem cheesy and
    <br> kinda. hm. like instrumenty? i know thats stupid but they just didnt really sound good to me, but then i heard how toby fox used them and now im like oh yeah the clavinet fucks dude
    <br> anyways. the slow introduction of the strings and the way new percussion is introduced like every couple of beats is really nice too. and halfway in or so the introduction of that bell
    <br> in whatever weird key thats in is reeeaaaaaaally cool
    <br> anyways, i have my initial arrangement of it. but i also want to try to introduce a bunch of the elements im thinking about from versus. but im goin to the library so whateva
