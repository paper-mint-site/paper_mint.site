    </audio>

    <br> listened to ruins from undertale. wanted to make something similar. ruins seems to use some a minor or other mode. most audible on C and F as those are the lowered notes
    <br>  made something with a similar melody in the same key using piano and space voice from sgm. came out ok. its not the most upbeat thing ever, but i dont think its supposed to be.
    <br> the sgm piano sounds are pretty nice, but the upper/ lower voices on 1 and 3 are meh. so i used piano 1 for lower, then piano 2 for middle tones. not perfect but it works. i guess
    <br> i could try a couple different things, but i dont think it would make a huge difference. ill mess with the eq later
    <br> in the main melody i dont think theres enough difference from the initial melody and the repsonse melody. i think the contrast between main and main 2 is good.
    <br> but just within main? the melody needs a little work. and in support 2, the melody and response arent different enough. it feels like only the rhythm changes
    <br> the first support is basic, but honestly i think its good that way. once another instrument/melody gets added there i think itll be enough.
    <br> the second support is nice too. i was saying earlier about it only being a rhythm change within it but it works cause thats just for the transition
    <br> not sure what other instruments i can add to it right now, and ill probably sub the space voice out once i find something better, but it sounds nice enough
