    <br> listened to kirby super star and wrote something. idk if i like it.



    <br> time to learn like

        <source src="time_to_learn_like_two.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

    <br> gonna go clean up and take a shower before i really listen to/judge this. think im kind of moody and hate it cause im hot/sweaty/in a bad mood. but its also just not that good lol
    <br> like always, sounds are rough since initial pass. but ignoring that:
    <br> coming back to it now i like it lol. just had a headache/was feelin angry or somethin. idk.
    <br> real critiques though, the main melody feels a little too basic. feels like i might have actually copied a kirby melody and made it like less interesting.
    <br> like i dont know what song it is but i feel as if i copied SOMETHING. anyways, copied or not, the melody feels a little basic.
    <br> dont mind the harmony/chord progressions, just feels like the rhythm is a little plain. but to be honest, for nice simple things like this,
    <br> i dont mind a simple melody. feels like having something complex wouldnt be quite as relaxing. really appreciating that wood block rn for some reason lol
    <br> its just a pretty nice simple time keeper for something like this, specially with the cute sounds. kirby super star has a lot of those.
    <br> like the fade in and out of the main melody too. ill have to bring that out a bit
    <br> also need to polish up the fade in/out of the arp. starts a little loud still. really funny that the arp sounds that nice considering its just the pitched up flute.
    <br> really thought that higher pitches of that sample would sound really screechy. but no. just play it nicely/quickly enough and it sounds really nice.


    <br> time to learn like v2
    <audio controls>
        <source src="time_to_learn_like_v2.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> made some of those changes. sounds much smoother now. could always use more polishing but i want to think about either finishing it up or doing another section.
    <br> it actually sounds nice now. dont even want to change it. feels as complete as i want it to be. again, could polish it but nah.
    <br> i think i should just move on. i want to do more kirby but something more upbeat next.
    <br> typed that, went to make a new project and realized that i literally did that like a few hours ago here it is

    <br> kirby_upbeat
    <audio controls>
        <source src="kirby_upbeat.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> honestly like it a lot more now than when i was making it. dunno if ill keep going with it. dont think i like it THAT much.
    <br> specially considering the way that second vox section resolves. it sounds really. spooky? but in a basic way that i dont really like
    <br> and the second melody for the horn is really derivative of the first part. which i dont like very much. anyways i dont think it turned out BAD.
    <br> just not good enough to keep going with. but what was good about it for reference?
    <br> really like that quick horn setup for the reverb in the first section. didnt really realize that the echo of the percussion lines up so well with the 
    <br> horn echo. like that. but i like the way that the horn has a really simple melody, but the echo gives that one note such a nice emphasis for how simple it is.
    <br> same with the percussion. really simple rhythm, but that echo on that one note really emphasizes its importance.
    <br> could use a different main melody when the vox comes in. sounds a little weird the way it is. cant quite put my finger on why, but if i had to say its because
    <br> its too complicated to be in the background.
    <br> going to nightlurk/stalk/wander/ponder and go to bed. maybe ill work on this more tomorrow.
