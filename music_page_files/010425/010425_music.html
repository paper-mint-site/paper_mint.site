    <br> nightmare knight by toby fox for reference.
    <br> really sick harmony in the beginning there. the drifting away of the pitch is cool. the horn has some kind of chorus thing going on, but he might just be doing that manually.
    <br> oh, drum hat panning. thats cool never noticed that. really sick transition between first and second sections. just what i was talking about, with enough change to be different,
    <br> not to feel like a new song. couple different variations in that section with different percussion/sounds/balances. third or fourth section has a cool quicker rehash of the initial theme.
    <br> drifting of tone at the end is cool also.

    <br> uh i ended up not doing that. i dont remember what i had to go do but i ended up doing this instead. anyways it sounds pretty good
    <br> i sampled my piano for an upcoming spc, and i thought the piano sample i got sounded nice. although theres a little static in the background
    <br> cause i recorded it with my microphone that isnt very good. idk how else to record samples, i dont have an audio recorder...
    <br> anyways its good enough to write with. and that quality gives it a little personality so its ok.
    <br> i dont remember what i had in mind. i was sort of thinking of moonsetter but i could swear there was something else.
    <br> just started with a little sweet sounding melody. i hit one key and i heard a short melody and went from there.
    <br> just used reverb and pulled up lower frequencies for the supporting keys. boosted higher frequencies for the main voice.
    <br> made the lower section sound a little warmer. really nice how much warmth the melody gets just from that short long short long note pattern in
    <br> the beginning. that was definitely something that i remembered from moonsetter.
    <br> strings dont sound quite right. i think the sample came out a little scratchy, but its mostly cause it doesnt sound the way i wanted it to.
    <br> it has the character of a lower string section, i had a more singular violin/viola sound in mind. would sound a little sweeter that way.
    <br> but it sounds nice this way too.
    <br> want to expand on this eventually. its actually a really nice motif, if a little cliche.
    <br> hmmm cant find any problems with it other than it being a little short. but i mostly just wrapped it up cause its getting late, so thats not really a
    <br> bad thing. little things like this dont take much to feel complete i think. like, theres only two sounds. and the sounds themselves sound good.
    <br> the composition is nice the way it is. its a simple little composition. and its perfect for its own certain purpose. i cant really think of what id use it in
    <br> though. ive been trying to think of some pieces as being kind of "purpose driven" for a long time. arnold schoenberg kind of talked about that in theory of 
    <br> harmony, about viewing music theory as a tool to make a piece that fit some sort of purpose. like how many sensibilities in theory sort of came from
    <br> the need for music to be in a concert hall, or in a dance hall, at least in classical music. so at least for me, id like to try to identify a certain
    <br> purpose for the things i make. if you view things too generally, then it feels like theres no answer. cause there is no answer really. if you said:
    <br> "im going to write a song", that doesnt really define what youre trying to do. for what purpose? how are people going to listen to it? in what situation?
    <br> and does the music fit that situation? in some ways, there are a whole set of sensibilities that surround how people find what you make rather than
    <br> what you make itself. although personally the actual product is always going to be much more important than the rest, but its still an important
    <br> sensibility in my opinion, especially in something like a game where each moment in a story or maybe the activity the player is doing is so
    <br> different.

    <br> anyways. uh. what else about this? i think where i was going with that is that this piece is nice but i cant imagine where id use it. i guess as much as
    <br> i want to think about things that are purpose driven, i havent really had that luxury cause i wasnt good enough. am i good enough now?
    <br> i mean, maybe situationally. at least for the little album i have together for kohoma it all feels somewhat cohesive since its all m8bit
    <br> and ive kind of had them sitting together for a while tweaking them to be more cohesive. i really just need to start writing more for those...
    <br> but i still dont feel like i have a wide enough range of samples and skill with synths to really make a well themed kind of soundtrack.
    <br> i think ill just have to live with it being a little scattered. and that allows me to have more variety anyway, so its not all bad.
    <br> cant fit this in with 8 bit. i wonder if i could make a 8bit version of this sound cohesive. i have a feeling it wouldnt translate very well.
    <br> maybe if i slow it down a bit and use a triangle wave for lower piano. actually that could work. but still, in what story situation?
    <br> and the melody doesnt really fit in with the rest of the game. hmmmmmm....

    <br> i have a lot to think about this. but its late and i gotta clean up.
