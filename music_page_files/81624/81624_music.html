    <br> been a while. i have to post some of the stuff from the past couple weeks eventually. but i dont really know what to even put here cause
    <br> half of it was just practicing piano and the other half is some music that was almost cool and i spent a lot of time just learning about old games and composers and stuff.
    <br> anyways. im gonna get back to it now.

    <br> gameboy pokemon intro like
    <audio controls>
        <source src="pokemon wind title theme.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> i was doing a lot of looking into zero rangers inspiration cause its music is awesome then i was looking at the gradius series etc etc...
    <br> eventually i somehow started listening to gameboy music again. maybe cause i finally fixed that gameboy by ripping the dc connector out lol
    <br> anyways those pokemon intro music songs are so fucking fire. so i wanted something that had a good transition from beautiful to mysterious to adventrous and exciting
    <br> and dangerous to grand and majestic. i think it worked. starting with the simple chord arpeggiation through chords whatever i just played around. slow to pause for transition
    <br> quick arpeggiations through dangerous sounding scales to shiny arpeggiation which transitions to grander melody bam title screen
    <br> is basically what i did i think. which i didnt add any percussion/rhythm my first pass through so ill have to do that :I. i feel as if it wont be as natural
    <br> if im not doing it "in the moment" so i sometimes regret not getting everything out before i stop holding my breath so to speak.

    <br> anyways im sort of trying to think of what else i could add to this. i mean the structure is there. some volume automation tweaking, eq
    <br> the supporting tri wave at the end, percussion, various smaller supporting melodies throughout/"decoration"/ maybe another section near the end.
    <br> geez im exploring a lot of different musical styles right now which makes me question the current thing that im doing.
    <br> ill be like oh i should make some pokemon-like music as an experiment, then whoops i want to make a creature collector, or a zelda like arpg,
    <br> or a bullethell gradius like etc etc. ugh. gotta focus. i still dont think that im gonna work on coding or any game project for a while, at least not heavily
    <br> just gonna keep grinding away at music, like, indefinitely.
