    <br> listened to stronger monsters and made something pretty quickly. its really rough soundwise, but i like the compostition overall.
    <br> just started with a really basic melody. the intial idea was just that really basic piano melody at the beginning. like always.
    <br> overall im really glad i can make something pretty upbeat without too many major effects. i mean the only effects i used were equalizers,
    <br> and thats sort of not really even an effect. listening to that snes stuff really cleared me up. it always felt as if i was missing something. like i needed
    <br> some effect to sound good. just polish the basics! most effects are pretty simple reinterpretations of the original sound anyways. just use some supporting notes,
    <br> echoed notes, play with the velocity a bit or whatever and it changes the character of the sound an incredible amount. i dont like the really complicated sounds that much anyways,
    <br> at least not in the kinds of things that i want to make
    <br> i like the stop pauses in the intro segment. feels like cheating given that it gives the song so much more flavor while only having to write like a few notes and just 
    <br> stop all of the other sounds lol. but whatever, its nice variety and it sounds good i think
    <br> piano in the beginning is kinda basic. laying the tubular bells over it helps, but its still a little plain. not sure what other sounds id use there though.
    <br> the orch hits sound sort of strange in the second section when they go higher, but thats kinda just how the samples sound since theyre
    <br> so much shorter when theyre higher. wait its still missing percussion

    <br> i went back and added percussion literally just now as in while writing the previous paragraph. think it sounds better this way. the crash is pretty overbearing though
    <br> but i cant be bothered to change the volume i already exported it. ill fuck with it if i continue with this song, which i (probably) wont
    <br> who says i cant write upbeat stuff?!?!?!?! i literally say that for good reason. this is good progress though. its still kind of easy to write upbeat stuff with these kinds of sounds in my opinion.
    <br> its cool but its not super unique maybe? i dunno its not my favorite thing ever.
