    <br> wrote game/music for brackeys jam. its alright. not great. i think that the melodies/structures themselves are alright. but i exclusively used magic 8 for those songs,
    <br> which made sense cause time constraint/im not really good enough to use "real sounds"/ it fit with the simple 1 bit visuals. but the actual sound quality was questionable.
    <br> even for magic 8 bit. anyways i want to get back into sampling/ripping snes stuff/just writing music. or maybe just writing music for hyper_storm specifically, since its already
    <br> "finished", and i can focus on just writing music for it rather than coding. but if i get better at music, i wont be able to do the illustration cause the music will be "too good"
    <br> for 1 bit art. not too good just real sounding sounds dont really fit monochrome. anyways thats a problem for tomorrow/whoever i get to do art for me

    <br> axelay test intro one

    <br> was ripping samples from lots of snes stuff, particularly axelay. finally got my snes cart loaded too, so i can actually play all those old shmups. gonna play gradius 3, the r types,
    <br> axelay, there were a couple other ones. anyways they have really nice sounds. wanna try and touch on those.

    <br> cave story like i guess
