    <br> wrote game/music for brackeys jam. its alright. not great. i think that the melodies/structures themselves are alright. but i exclusively used magic 8 for those songs,
    <br> which made sense cause time constraint/im not really good enough to use "real sounds"/ it fit with the simple 1 bit visuals. but the actual sound quality was questionable.
    <br> even for magic 8 bit. anyways i want to get back into sampling/ripping snes stuff/just writing music. or maybe just writing music for hyper_storm specifically, since its already
    <br> "finished", and i can focus on just writing music for it rather than coding. but if i get better at music, i wont be able to do the illustration cause the music will be "too good"
    <br> for 1 bit art. not actually "too good" its just real sounding sounds dont really fit monochrome. anyways thats a problem for tomorrow/whoever i get to do art for me

    <br> axelay test intro one

        <source src="axelay_test_intro.ogg" type="audio/ogg">

    <br> was ripping samples from lots of snes stuff, particularly axelay. finally got my snes cart loaded too, so i can actually play all those old shmups. gonna play gradius 3, the r types,
    <br> axelay, there were a couple other ones. anyways they have really nice sounds. wanna try and touch on those.

    <br> axelay test intro two
    <br> <audio controls>
        <source src="axelay_test_intro_2.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> wanted to have the cool atmospheric creepy sounds to clear bright sounds in the beginning, but i wanted to get the song out so i didnt bother to clean it up. so its just kinda there.
    <br> the kinda cool back/forth thing that the strings are doing was not me, its just the samples looping since im playing a few of them at different pitches and theyre different speeds cause pitch up/down
    <br> which i thought was funny cause its like the nicest part of this track imo and it was on accident lol. whatever ill take what i can get
    <br> trumpet doesnt sound quite right. its a little harsh. also the melody is pretty simple. not a lot of change. which is fine but i still want to have more sections with more variance eventually.
    <br> the actual axelay intro has all these different samples/sections/melodies/animations, its really extremely impressive
