    <br> really want to go make a sorta space themed alien shootemup bullet hell game now. this turned out really cool
    <br> not gonna cancel everything for it obviously but that would be so rad. id love to do my own take on a zero ranger someday
    <br> although it would never be as good

    <br> was listening to gradius 3 ost. i feel like whenever i try to make something derivative it always turns into something kind of different
    <br> which is equal parts frustrating and good. cause i want to make original stuff but if im trying to make something "like gradius" and i make something different on accident,
    <br> it feels unintentional. 
    <br> also i should be making more chiptune. gotta get back into gameboy stuff
