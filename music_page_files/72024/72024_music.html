    <br> forget the other day THIS is the badass early 2000s brother theme song.
    <br> was listening to toby foxes old homestuck music. its a little derivative in terms of the sound but its still baller as fuck
    <br> doesnt even compare to the swag of toby foxes shit though
    <br> fuck its late i want to work on it more but my brain hurts, so many little tacky pieces i wanna fix not to mention i could probably a couple more sections. could be 2-3 min if i can stay creative the whole way through
    <br> both guitars need longer decays with probably 70-80% sustain, i gotta find a better drumkit cause this ones kinda weak. also its quiet so i need to raise the volume of the percussion
    <br> but i didn't cause i didnt wanna do automations yet and it wouldve been too loud later. or maybe i forgot idk. also im not sure what the 8bit arpeggiation at the end needs
    <br> but it sounds just a little out of place. sounds like its still on the gameboy. not sure what i mean by that. too plain? maybe some reverb would do it? or i could fuck with the equalizer. idk
    <br> anyways not a bad thing. gotta find more sounds though. ill probably keep listening to toby fox stuff and making shit adjacently inspired and such
    <br> also the piano is just a little disappointing? honestly i like it the way it is. can mess with eq but i mean its a free plugin so its doing the fuck out of its job rn considering lol
    <br> lower piano notes kinda be like that no matter the piano quality. always hard as fuck
    <br> going to bed im fucking tired. debated putting this in 71924 but its 20 by morning technicality

    <br> i mean. its nice, but its plain. im sure it would fit in something. id have to adapt it a bit. i like the melody at least
    <br> the rhodes sounds nice, but i feel as if the sound could use a little change
    <br> percussions nice, but maybe it sounds a little too natural? although im sure that would be desirable in certain cases
    <br> im really starting to appreciate the sgm soundfont. its basic, but its great for just getting stuff out.
    <br> maybe itll be good for making things prototypically, then swapping out the sounds with more substantial ones later
    <br> not sure what else to say about this. its nice though

    <br> more old toby fox homestuck inspired stuff. his old homestuck work was really cool.
    <br> i hope i can someday come back and use this stuff/improve these. they just sound really amateur right now.
    <br> the basic pieces are there. its just not all that interesting.
    <br> its still good improvement. i think that more "basic" work is better for polishing those fundamental skills anyways
    <br> cause then you can get a good feel for the entire creative process rather than spending a bajillion years "perfecting"
    <br> one thing. you can experiment with lots of different sounds, scales, and not worry about "perfect". although
    <br> those kinds of nice polished sounds can add a lot to the music. theres just some good balance that im sure changes depending on the situation
    <br> like what does the project call for? maybe it fits better with a certain project if its more polished, or 
    <br> if youre doing something just for practicing a specfic thing, dont worry about the other things too much
    <br> anyways, im glad i can put smaller things like this out fairly quickly.
