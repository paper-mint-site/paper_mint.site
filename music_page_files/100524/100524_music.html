    <br> dug some old computer speakers out of my closet, got the urge to make something with axelay samples cause of the cool sound from said computer speakers

    <br> axelay battle cool
    <audio controls>
        <source src="axelay_battle_cool.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> pretty unpolished in terms of audio balancing and stuff. sounds nice though. really like the simple chord progressions, especially the vox. and the jumps at the end of the horn sections.
    <br> want to add a second section but i couldnt really think of anything. itd be pretty complete if i did add one though. honestly one of the better things ive made with those samples.
    <br> god i wish i knew someone who could make cool sprite art, if i can actually nail this kind of music could actually make something cool w it i think


    <br> axelay battle cool two
    <audio controls>
        <source src="axelay_battle_cool_two.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> made a second section. dont really like it. well i like the harmony, but its obviously unfinished and the melody needs a little rhythmic change/variation. it sounds nice, but the melody is a little boring.
    <br> obviously the vox chords are literally repeated through the entire rest of the piece. even in the first section theyre a little repetitive.
    <br> but im fucking melting its like 85 in here. need a cold shower and some oj. might come back to work on this later. actually like it quite a bit
