    <br> heard some homestuck like tones this morning, wrote it down, ended up continuing.
    <br> i like it but its in its initial phases. needs more different sounds. honestly just wanna use the same sound pallette as toby fox for this kind of music.
    <br> but i also wanna be original. should i be a normie and just use 4front/dvs sax/magic 8? or should i try something weird???? idk ill continue this later.
    <br> in terms of the melody, i want to expand more. I have another section and a half written but theres no supporting tones yet so i left those out of this version.
