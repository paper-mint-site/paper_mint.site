    <br> EPIC NUTS MIXTAPE THREE!!!!!!!
    <br> i like it. sounds crazy and good. the end if fucked up cause i stopped using timing and just slid shit around cause the samples sort of imposed their own time.
    <br> so the tempo is largely by inuition near the end. gotta fix it its still a little fucked up
    <br> gets potentially a little too crazy near the end of the second section. sounds cool but im likely gonna tone it down a bit. 
    <br> and volume balance like the whole thing
    <br> got a bunch of other shit wrong wit it, also the last section is essentially just a repeat of the second and the second to last section kinda sucks. i want
    <br> it to be kind of a longer track so im gonna try a couple of things. but idk.
    <br> also how much time do i wanna spend on this? ermmmm idk. whatever im playing metaphor don got time fo dis shit
