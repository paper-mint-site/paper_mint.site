    <br> 8/12/24

    <br> got busy with stuff/practicing piano/didnt want to open a daw for/cleaning like a week
    <br> also just got kind of lazy. but im back for a while i think. anyways.

    <br><br> nes_qmark <br>
    <audio controls>
        <source src="nes_qmark.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> heard this so i wrote it out in like 5 minutes. just a cliched alternating f# g chord to sound as if in question, with tension.
    <br> in magic 8 because what else would i use lol.
    <br> i want to see if there are other effects i can use to make magic 8 sound cooler.
    <br> and start actually getting good at working with the advanced options text editor rather than the knobs, which i sort of have been but i only ever really use it to make sort of echoey effects.
    <br> 

    <br> listened to "the sea has returned" from zero ranger. wanted to make something carefree like that, using a basic piano plugin, with some nice synth sounds. i dont think im good enough at sytrus
    <br> or any synthesizer right now to get such sweet tones right now lol. but itd be really nice to eventually be able to.
    <br> on that note, once you finish the song structure for this you should work on the default v3 template. add a sytrus/other synth section, maybe add gold drums, add those groups/effects. then also
    <br> see if theres any group bussing you can/should do. i dont think it would hurt to have it set up at least. at worst it'll just be a little extra resource heavy. which sucks but its not that bad.
    <br> i should also go through and cut any drag that i dont use. cause the boot time is increasing lol. i gotta drop some unnecessary shit
    <br> so i think one thing that i do a lot it kind of elaborate the main melody when i shouldn't/ dont need to.
    <br> like, the main melody for this is just f# A F# B quickly. it sounds nice on piano. the melody for zero ranger is simlarly simple, but i didnt bother to actually transcribe it. zero ranger has a lot of really awesome sounds.
