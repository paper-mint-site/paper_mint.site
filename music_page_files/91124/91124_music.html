    <br> school fucking sucks in a just fucking end my shit kinda mood
    <br> not really i just want to get back to writing music for this jam so fuck everything ill just do that


    <br> hyper storm intro
    <br> <audio controls>
        <source src="hyper_storm_zero.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> wah wah it doesnt sound like i want it to wah wah the ending sucks cause its rushed
    <br> cry about it stupid baby gotta crank this shit out for brackeys jam


    <br> cave story like i guess
    <br> <audio controls>
        <source src="cave_story_like.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>

    <br> i dont really know where this came from either. i wrote the intro for hyper_storm and this just kinda naturally followed. couldn't tell you for my life
    <br> i also dont really know why it sounds like cavestory other than the fact that its chiptune. something about the kinda mysterious harmonies. whatever it sounds cool
    <br> those long noise percussion sounds are really fucking crunchy. i wasnt really even trying to do that, it just kinda came out that way. sounds nice
    <br> thisll probably be either be for the start screen or the base. probably the base
