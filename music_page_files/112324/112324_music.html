    <br> whoa im back. hopefully ill be uploading here more for the next couple days as i polish up koho music. maybe not, i dont really want people to hear the stuff i make before its in the game. i think
    <br> this site is coming to and end... not like anyone looked at it in the first place.
    <br> just dont really want people to see the things i make and read things that I write. everything I make/share is going to be percieved as part of anything i make.
    <br> so I dont really want my own voice mixed up in that. you know? but i think the more ideal thing to do in that case is to just make this a more ideal site.
    <br> figure out what i really wnat from it. you know? one thing that comes to mind is how do people know when new things are here. like do they have to check to see if theres new stuff,
    <br> or is it just a check it whenever they remember kind of thing? and who am i thinking about? like friends? or online randos?
    <br> for friends, id rather have them just check whenever they remember. unless it like "comes up" in conversation.
    <br> 
    <br> ok. what is the purpose of this website? lets just focus on music sharing for now actually.
    <br> so for friends, its just a place where i can upload music in a more convinient/interesting place than like a bandcamp or something.
    <br> for online people/potential video game buyers, its something that i can upload to in order to show people the kind of things that i make, so maybe theyd be interested in my projects.
    <br> fuck its early i gotta bed, think about this later
    <br>



    <br> and the other site.

    <br> hmmm... things to think about. anyways

    <br> sparkle cave

        <source src="sparkle_cave.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>
    <br> just something i wrote while listening to mario land 2 golden coins. more kazumi totaka stuff. he has lots of dreamy melody. wish id found/appreciated his music a lot sooner.
    <br> hes going to be an incredibly good source of inspiration for gameboy music i think. need to listen to more. frog for whom the bell tolls, links awakening, mario maker, etc. 
    <br> that fucking n64 jet ski game apparently too. unbelievably good music for what sort of looked like shovelware.
    <br> anyways the balancing isn't very well done. theres lots of places where the velocity could use tweaking. but the bigger problem is that the sections are pretty disconnected.
    <br> and its a pretty short thing. i dont think its really going to be good for much other than being an interesting house. but i dont really mind all of these little tracks being used in a one
    <br> and done kind of way. just cramming lots of music into this thing. its weird though. its a little too upbeat to be a house theme. but I wouldnt really want it as a battle theme either.
    <br> i feel like a lot of times i write something and ill be like "oh, this would be a good song to stick in the options menu". but i do that so often with like songs that dont fit anywhere else
    <br> to justify writing them. hm. this would be a good town theme i think. or for a shop. oh fuck yeah this is a shop theme.
