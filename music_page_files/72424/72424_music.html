    <br> it sounds like its supposed to, but i feel as if its missing character. stays in one key too long, should try to incorporate another key into the melody/incorporate some other instruments.
    <br> its easy to write a melody in a single key. but its boring. if you want to get the tone that mixture between different keys will get you, you gotta be a lot more
    <br> conscious of the current key and how long youve been in it
    <br> anyways, i was trying to make something similar to tragic reconstruction from mother 3. its pretty recognizable, but its hard not to be with samples this obvious
    <br> again, they key did fit. it just didnt feel like anything special. and it leaned quite heavily on percussion, which sounds ok, but again, a little boring.
    <br> and a little heavy on the ears honestly. maybe try to use a little less drums when doing something like this, and try to make the most of the percussion that you do
    <br> use. via slight velocity changes, pitch changes, a slightly more complex rhythm, etc. balancing the volume audio would help, but not really by much, so i didnt bother
    <br> also i usually use a plugin of some kind for delay, but somehow it only just dawned on me that you can do a "delay reverb" really quickly/easily for just a note or two by
    <br> repeating the note on the piano roll. really obvious, and you wouldnt want to have to do it for the whole piece. but it makes it easier to do a one off thing, and gives you more control over how each note sounds.
    <br> i spent a couple hours trying to find the actual best way to do soundfonts as well. its not super complicated, its just that the programs that do exist to play them are a little dated/buggy. or so i read on reddit/other forums...
    <br> maybe cause they arent used professionally very often anymore? at least outside of the indie sphere. though sforzando has been working pretty well. but importing instruments by sfz sucks
    <br> i was just using the native fl plugin but apparently its deprecated/buggy as hell(according to forums) so theres no new updates. i was wondering why the volume envelopes werent working properly...
    <br> whatever. ill deal. ill just manually envelope them with stfu at the worst. which is incredibly annoying, but whaddya gonna do aboudit
