    <br> it sounds like its supposed to, but i feel as if its missing character. stays in one key too long, should try to incorporate another key into the melody/incorporate some other instruments.
    <br> its easy to write a melody in a single key. but its boring. if you want to get the tone that mixture between different keys will get you, you gotta be a lot more
    <br> conscious of the current key and how long youve been in it
    <br> anyways, i was trying to make something similar to tragic reconstruction from mother 3. its pretty recognizable, but its hard not to be with samples this obvious
    <br> again, they key did fit. it just didnt feel like anything special. and it leaned quite heavily on percussion, which sounds ok, but again, a little boring.
    <br> and a little heavy on the ears honestly. maybe try to use a little less drums when doing something like this, and try to make the most of the percussion that you do
    <br> use. via slight velocity changes, pitch changes, a slightly more complex rhythm, etc. balancing the volume audio would help, but not really by much, so i didnt bother
    <br> also i usually use a plugin of some kind for delay, but somehow it only just dawned on me that you can do a "delay reverb" really quickly/easily for just a note or two by
    <br> repeating the note on the piano roll. really obvious, and you wouldnt want to have to do it for the whole piece. but it makes it easier to do a one off thing, and gives you more control over how each note sounds.
    <br> i spent a couple hours trying to find the actual best way to do soundfonts as well. its not super complicated, its just that the programs that do exist to play them are a little dated/buggy. or so i read on reddit/other forums...
    <br> maybe cause they arent used professionally very often anymore? at least outside of the indie sphere. though sforzando has been working pretty well. but importing instruments by sfz sucks
    <br> i was just using the native fl plugin but apparently its deprecated/buggy as hell(according to forums) so theres no new updates. i was wondering why the volume envelopes werent working properly...
    <br> whatever. ill deal. ill just manually envelope them with stfu at the worst. which is incredibly annoying, but whaddya gonna do aboudit

    <br> listened to fallen down for the somethingeth time. i somehow am still not quite tired of it, despite listening to it
    <br> obsessively for like a year straight while learning it on piano
    <br> anyways, this track sounds really nice and not too derivative, but its largely due to the really nice vox in sgm.
    <br> also cause i couldnt turn down sustain cause apparently thats still not working and im not using stfu rn cause its annoying.
    <br> and it still sounds nice its just kinda overly effecty. it just continues to ring too long.
    <br> anyways, the overall melody is nice. theres a decent amount of change in the key even, and its not too tacky.
    <br> but there are still a lot of parts where the melody is a little tacky that i do want to change.
    <br> and it doesnt sound finished. its just sort of half completed. feels like there should be a second half.
    <br> i suppose a lot of these tracks are gonna be that way since theyre all done in less than an hour, but still
    <br> i would like it to have a sense of completion. maybe therell be a reprise someday lol
    <br> anyways, i guess i STILL need to fix soundfonts, or figure out whats happening in juicysf
    <br> maybe im just dumb idk lol
    <br> not bad work on these today. im still wondering when/if Ill go back to piano though. still feels like my fundamental rhythm/tone center needs calibrating. but im still doing
    <br> much much better than before. and i wont have much time once school starts again, so maybe thatll get pushed back
    <br> plus, i still have to make an actual game lol. i still think this is what i need to be doing, but it just felt like when i wrote music, i would keep on getting slightly better at it,
    <br> and id be like oh why dont i make something better, and id throw away the old piece in favor of something new and better. which why wouldnt i? but also i need to make something and stick to it.
    <br> it would just be really weird to have really shitty music in the beginning, then better music in the end. or for the quality to be plain inconsistent.
    <br> i guess what im trying to say is that i feel like i continue to make new things and gather more perspective, then realize the thing i made before was wrong. 
    <br> then i would make a new thing, realize that wasnt great, then remake it, yada yada whatever. so i wanted to just spend a while making experimental things with mostly just music and improvement in mind.
    <br> which i think is working. ugh.
    <br> i just dont know when to quit that cycle. when do just say "ok. its good enough" and just make everything at that level?
