    <br> heres some stuff i made:

    <br> rain on glass

        <source src="rain_on_glass.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    </audio>
    <br>
    started trying to make sounds myself again. i think my ear got a little better after doing simpler magic8 bit melodies and sound making. also, sound is relative to the composition, which is something i got a better sense for.
    it sounds pretty nice.

    <br> probably my coolest homestuck like piece. i really want to finish this up eventually but its not a priority. what if it had more samples? what if there was more melody, timing rhythm percussion changes?
    <br> a whole 2-3 more additionaly minutes of song? would be epic.

    was improvement for me at the time but i wasnt really happy with it overall. i was trying pretty hard to
    force myself to use samples in creative ways, but i still feel like i dont have the vision to really experiment
    without kind of looking for something particular and not experimenting. or id get a couple samples together that sound one way,
    and get an idea of what i want, then not be able to imagine how other samples could factor into that. hmmmmmm

    not sure why i feel this way, but i feel like its easy to make something cool with slap bass. its just a very versatile sound for some reason.
    or maybe it just sounds good by itself? im not really sure why, i used to hate it. but i heard it used in zero ranger/homestuck or something
    and now i really like it

    common trend I see with these is the practice sort of identifying certain keys in certain things and being able to reproduce something similar.

    its really simple but its nice. nice sounds actually. i need to work on ripping sounds out of shans so i can use them in a sampler.
    unless i can actually get soundfonts working
